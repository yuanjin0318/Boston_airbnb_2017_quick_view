# Boston_AirBNB_2017_quick_view

## Objective
I have a quick view of the Boston Airbnb information in the year of 2017, I tried to implement the CRISP-DM method for this data analysis. There were a few questions I had in mind regarding the dataset that I tried to find. These Questions were the following:

> 1. How is the general price distribution of Airbnb in Boston? 

> 2. Whether there is a “hot-season” or “cold-season” for Airbnb in Boston? 

> 3. The general price variations according to months and seasons

> 4. Which area is "hottest" for Boston Airbnb and which region is the most expensive?

I have also written a Medium Blog Post about it which can be accessed here.

In my Github repository, I also included a prediction model to predict the Airbnb price, in which I did not find much useful information, so that I did not include that part to my medium post.
